# Setting Up Project

To begin:

> npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss
    
> npm install graphql graphql-request html-react-parser moment react-multi-carousel sass

The above is all of our dependencies that we'll be using.

> npm run dev

To start the app.

## Clean Up

Delete everything inside the `index.js` except for the `Head` component.

This is going to be our `Home` component.

As far as setting up the project, this is it. We're ready to code.
